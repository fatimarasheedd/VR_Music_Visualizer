# VR_Music_Visualizer

This project needs to be used in tandem with the https://github.com/fatimarasheedd/ScrapSpotifyTrackInfo. You'll need to drag the trackanalysis.csv file, album_artwork assets, and the mp3 audio files (these aren't generated by the other repo - you need to download them yourself). The mp3 tracks must go in the resources file, the rest goes in the assets folder.

1. Complete the instructions from ScrapSpotifyTrackInfo, and move the stated assets into this VR_Music_Visualiser project
2. Make sure your headset and controllers are properly set up
3. This video provides an overview of how the experience goes [].

The main objective of this project was to build a VR music visualiser that focused on using visuals to convey musical information, rather than just be an aesthetic tool. Hopefully, its working toward making the musical experience more inclusive for diverse communities who may have hearing impariments so they can understand the emotionality of music.

This was done for my MSc Computer Science disseration at UCL.
